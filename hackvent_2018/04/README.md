# Day 04: pirating like in the 90ies

In this challenge we have to find the correct numbers to get the flag.

When searching for the names (Nebraska, Tortuga, Antigua, Jamaica, St.Kitts, Barbados, Montserrat) we come across "The
Secret of Monkey Island". The early releases of this game came with a copy-protection in the form of a cardboard wheel.
With this it was clear what we had to do.

Using this [tool](https://www.oldgames.sk/docs/Dial-A-Pirate/) we had to align the upper and lower half of the head and
then read from the correct name to get the number.
