# Day 05: OSINT 1

The subtitle of this challenge was _It's all about transparency_. We had to check the certificate transparency logs. To
do this I used [this site](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates) and entered `hackvent.org`. This
revealed another subdomain `osintiscoolisntit.hackvent.org` which contained the flag.
