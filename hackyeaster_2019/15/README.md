## Solution

To solve this challenge I first went to the steemit profile of the challenge author, darkstar. From there I went to [his
wallet](https://steemitwallet.com/@darkstar-42/transfers) and searched for transactions that included the text "Hacky
Easter". I quickly found a transaction with a hidden note:

```
Transfer 0.001 SBD to ctf | Hacky Easter 2019 takes place between April and May 2019. Take a note: nomoneynobunny
