# H2 - Hidden Two

## Description

Author: inik

Again a hidden flag.

## Solution

The zip of challenge [07](../07) contained a file named `3DULK2N7DcpXFg8qGo9Z9qEQqvaEDpUCBB1v.mp4`. This was odd since
the files usually did not have random looking names. I took the file name and used
[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)s magic function on it and got the flag `HV19{Dont_confuse_0_and_O}`.
