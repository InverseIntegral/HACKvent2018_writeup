# H4 - Hidden Four

## Description

Author: M.

## Solution

The flag of [14](/14) (`s@@jSfx4gPcvtiwxPCagrtQ@,y^p-za-oPQ^a-z\x20\n^&&s[(.)(..)][\2\1]g;s%4(...)%"p$1t"%ee`)seemed to
be just a random string. But when interpreting it as Perl code it would print `Squ4ring the Circle` which was the last
hidden flag.
